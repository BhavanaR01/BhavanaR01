🔍 From Testing Bugs 🧪 to Testing Insights 📊 — Aspiring Data Analyst on a Growth Journey 🚀

✨ About Me
Hi there! 👋 I’m an Aspiring Data Analyst with a background in Software Testing 🧪 (Manual Testing). My testing journey has trained me to be detail-oriented 🔍, curious 🤔, and quality-focused ✅ — skills I now love applying to the world of data 📊.

💡 What I’ve been up to:
🔹 SQL 🗄️ – querying, analyzing, and solving case-based business problems

🔹 Python (Pandas & NumPy) 🐍 – cleaning, transforming, and exploring real datasets

🔹 Data Visualization 📊 – building insights with Excel, Power BI, Matplotlib & Seaborn

🔹 Manual Testing 📝 – ensuring quality and precision through detailed test case design & execution

🔹 Projects & Case Studies 💼 – working with Uber, Swiggy, Zomato, and PhonePe datasets

🌱 Outside of work, you’ll usually find me:
🎶 enjoying music playlists,
📚 reading or learning new tech skills,
⚽ playing outdoor games or exploring fitness,
🎮 sometimes gaming or just diving into fun puzzles.

🚀 I love playing with data — spotting patterns, solving puzzles, and discovering insights that matter.

🤝 I’m excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, analysts, and recruiters. If you’re looking for someone who brings testing precision + data passion, feel free to check out my profile — I’d love to explore opportunities!
