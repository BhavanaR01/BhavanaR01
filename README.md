Hi there! 👋 
I’m an Aspiring Data Analyst with a background in Software Testing 🧪. My testing journey has trained me to be detail-oriented 🔍, curious 🤔, and quality-focused ✅ — skills I now love applying to the world of data 📊.

💡 What I’ve been up to:
🔹 SQL 🗄️ – querying, analyzing, and solving case-based business problems
🔹 Python (Pandas & NumPy) 🐍 – cleaning, transforming, and exploring real datasets
🔹 Data Visualization 📈 – turning raw numbers into stories with Excel, Matplotlib & Seaborn
🔹 Manual Testing 📝 – ensuring quality and precision through detailed test case design & execution
🔹 Projects & Case Studies 💼 – working with Uber, Swiggy, Zomato, and PhonePe datasets

🚀 I love playing with data — spotting patterns, solving puzzles, and discovering insights that matter.

🤝 I’m excited to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, analysts, and recruiters. If you’re looking for someone who brings testing precision + data passion, feel free to check out my profile — I’d love to explore opportunities!
